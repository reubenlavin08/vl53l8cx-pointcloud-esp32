## What it does

An ESP32-S3 talks to an **ST VL53L8CX** time-of-flight sensor over I²C, uploads ST's ULD firmware to the chip on boot, and streams the 64-zone depth grid as compact `DATA:d0,d1,…,d63\n` lines over USB-serial at 15 Hz. A Python visualiser reads those lines and renders the scene live — animated ToF rays from the sensor body, a side colour-bar with the distance scale, a Kabsch-based 6-DOF pose estimator, and a world-frame point memory that builds a rolling 3D scan as the sensor sweeps.

## The transformation — matplotlib → PyQtGraph

The visualiser was rewritten three times in a single weekend. The first cut used matplotlib `mplot3d`; mouse rotation was sluggish and the renderer was always one frame stale. v3 swapped in PyQtGraph + OpenGL, threaded the serial reader, and flipped the drain order. The clip below is 3 seconds of the original, then 7 seconds of v3:

| | v1 / v2 (matplotlib) | v3 (PyQtGraph) |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer | software-rendered `mplot3d` | GPU `GLViewWidget` + OpenGL |
| Mouse rotation | sluggish (GUI thread starved) | native — pan/zoom decoupled from data |
| Serial read | on GUI thread; 1 s timeout could stall | dedicated `QThread` with Qt signal |
| Drain order | read → process → drain (always one stale) | drain first, render newest valid frame |
| Smoothing | EMA α = 0.3 (~900 ms settle) | EMA α = 0.6 (~300 ms settle) |

<p align="center"><em>v4 in motion — sensor body, FoV frustum, animated ToF beams. Same scene as v6 but without the world-frame memory layer, so it's easier to identify each element on its own.</em></p>

| Element | What it is |
|---|---|
| **64 bright dots in a cone** | Live measurements, one per zone, coloured by distance (viridis: purple = close, yellow = far). |
| **Animated coloured beams from the sensor** | One ToF ray per zone, faded from the lens out to its endpoint, in the same hue as the point. They pulse with the live data — physically what a multizone ToF sensor is doing. |
| **Faded surrounding cloud** *(v6)* | Past observations in **world frame**, transformed back into the current sensor frame each tick and faded by age (~6 s memory). As you rotate, they slide off to the side instead of staying glued to the front. |
| **Yellow line behind the sensor** *(v5+)* | Estimated 6-DOF trajectory of the sensor's origin (last ~5 s), per-vertex alpha-faded so old segments disappear. |
| **Sensor body + lens ring at origin** | Flat dark rectangle modelling the SATEL-VL53L8CX face, with a bright lens circle and "VL53L8CX" label. |
| **Pale frustum** | The sensor's actual 45° × 45° field of view (per ST datasheet — 65° diagonal). |
| **Side colour bar** | Distance scale in mm. |
| **Status bar** | Live frame count, valid-zones / 64, mean valid distance, cumulative pose translation + rotation, and the per-frame rejection count. |

## Iteration story — v1 → v6

| Version | What it added | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **v1** | First working matplotlib 3D scatter. | Get *anything* on screen. |
| **v2** | In-place scatter update; serial-buffer drain; EMA smoothing. | Killed flicker, stale data, noise jitter. |
| **v3** | PyQtGraph + OpenGL; threaded serial; drain-first; α = 0.6; invalid-zone mask. | Fixed mouse-drag lag and one-frame-stale render. |
| **v4** | Side colour bar; X / Y / Depth axes; sensor body; FoV frustum; **animated ToF beams**. | Restored the "scientific" look + made the physics legible. |
| **v5** | **Kabsch / Procrustes 6-DOF relative pose estimator** with sanity gates and a trajectory trail. | First motion estimate from depth alone, no IMU. |
| **v6** | World-frame point memory (~6 s) re-projected each tick into the current sensor frame; per-vertex alpha-faded trail. | Makes the point cloud wrap around the sensor as it rotates instead of being glued to the front cone. |

## How the visualiser works

### Serial protocol
The ESP32 streams one compact line per frame:
```
DATA:820,815,801,790,...,(64 values total)
```
Invalid zones are clamped to `MAX_DISTANCE_MM` (= 4000 mm) on the firmware side, so the host always gets exactly 64 values. The visualiser detects the clamp and renders those zones with `α = 0`, hiding them. ESP_LOG lines in the same stream don't start with `DATA:` and are simply ignored by the parser.

### Threaded read pipeline
Serial reads run in a dedicated `QThread`; new frames are delivered to the GUI via a Qt signal. Each cycle drains everything currently buffered and keeps only the **newest** valid `DATA:` line — which kills the "rendering one frame stale" failure mode of the original `read → process → drain` order.

### Geometric projection
The VL53L8CX is **65° diagonal / 45° per axis**. Each of 8 zones along an axis subtends `45° ÷ 8 = 5.625°`. A unit direction vector is precomputed for every zone:

```text
h_angle = (col − 3.5) × 5.625°       v_angle = (row − 3.5) × 5.625°
x =  sin(h_angle)
y = −sin(v_angle)                     (row 0 is the top of the sensor view)
z =  cos(h_angle) × cos(v_angle)      (sensor boresight = +Z)
```

Multiplying each unit vector by its zone's measured distance gives the 3D point in the sensor's body frame.

### EMA smoothing
Raw zones jitter ±10–30 mm frame-to-frame on a static scene. Per-zone exponential moving average:

```python
smoothed[v] = 0.6 * new[v] + 0.4 * smoothed[v]
```

α = 0.6 settles to 95 % of a step input in `−ln(0.05) ÷ −ln(1 − 0.6) ≈ 3` samples — about 200 ms at 15 Hz.

### 6-DOF relative pose (Kabsch / Procrustes)

Closed-form rigid registration on consecutive 64-point clouds. Given paired sets P (frame k−1) and Q (frame k):

```text
1.  Pc, Qc      = P − mean(P), Q − mean(Q)
2.  H           = Pc.T @ Qc
3.  U, S, Vt    = svd(H)
4.  d           = sign(det(Vt.T @ U.T))         # reflection guard
5.  R           = Vt.T @ diag(1, 1, d) @ U.T
6.  t           = mean(Q) − R @ mean(P)
```

The fitted (R, t) maps a world point's old-frame coords to its new-frame coords. The **sensor's** per-frame motion is the inverse: `δR = R.T`, `δt = −R.T @ t`. World-frame cumulative pose composes as `T_world(k) = T_world(k-1) · δ`.

Same-zone correspondence relies on the small-motion assumption — at 15 Hz (~67 ms per frame) zone *i* in two consecutive frames still observes approximately the same world point. Wrong correspondence (fast motion) shows up as huge fitted Δt or ΔR; the estimator gates on `≤ 300 mm` and `≤ 20°` per frame and breaks the chain instead of corrupting cumulative state.

### World-frame point memory (v6)

Each frame, valid sensor-frame points are transformed via `world_p = R_world · sensor_p + t_world` and pushed into a rolling 6-second deque. For rendering, every entry is transformed *back* into the current sensor frame and given an alpha proportional to its age (newest = ~0.35, oldest = 0). The visual effect: as the sensor pans, old observations stay fixed in space and slide around — the "cone" effectively wraps around.

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Static screenshot — frame 1916, sensor pointed at a wall ~1800 mm away.</em></p>

### Honest limits

- 64 points × ±10–30 mm noise is sparse and noisy for ICP-style registration. Expect drift, especially in **yaw** (rotation around gravity is unobservable from a flat-floor depth map — no algorithm can recover it from depth alone).
- 0/64 valid zones (covered sensor, loose connection) → estimator pauses cleanly.
- The 6-second memory cap keeps drift damage local. With an IMU added later, the same code becomes a usable sparse 3D map.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Firmware  (ESP-IDF v5.0+, tested on v5.4.4)
cd vl53l8cx_esp32
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py -p COM12 flash         # adjust COM port for your machine

# 2. Visualiser (in a separate terminal — flash/monitor must be closed)
cd visualizer
python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python visualizer.py --port COM12
```

| Visualiser flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port` | `COM12` | Serial port the ESP32 is on |
| `--baud` | `115200` | Matches the ESP-IDF console default |
| `--max-mm` | `4000` | Z-axis range + colour-scale max (mm) |

**Hotkey:** press **`R`** in the visualiser window to reset the cumulative pose and clear the trail + accumulated cloud.

## Wiring

| SATEL pin | ESP32-S3 pin | Pull-up |
|---|---|---|
| `PWREN` | GPIO 5 | 10 kΩ → 3.3 V |
| `MCLK_SCL` | GPIO 2 | 2 × 1 kΩ in series → 3.3 V |
| `MOSI_SDA` | GPIO 1 | 2 × 1 kΩ in series → 3.3 V |
| `NCS` | 3.3 V | tied high (selects I²C) |

| `GND` | GND | — |

> Pull-up resistors connect **between the signal line and 3.3 V**, not in series along the wire. Power the sensor from 3.3 V — not 5 V. Use the **UART USB port** (left, on DevKitC-1) for flashing.

| `PRINT_GRID` | `0` | `1` for the ASCII 8×8 grid |
| `PRINT_CLOSEST_ONLY` | `0` | `1` for nearest-zone log only |
| `MAX_DISTANCE_MM` | `4000` | clamp value for invalid zones |

<details>
<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Sensor not detected | wiring issue | Check SDA/SCL aren't swapped, pull-ups go to 3.3 V (not in-line). |
| Silent hang after "interface starting" | I²C read timeout = `-1` (infinite) | Already fixed in `sdkconfig.defaults` (`CONFIG_VL53L8CX_I2C_TIMEOUT=y`, value 1000). |
| 5 V pin reads ~2 V | plugged into native USB port | Use the UART port, or power the sensor from 3.3 V (the SATEL LDO accepts 2.8–5.5 V). |
| Stack overflow | main stack too small | Already raised to 8192 bytes in `sdkconfig.defaults`. |
| Visualiser can't open COM12 | `idf.py monitor` is holding it | Close monitor (Ctrl + ]) before launching the Python visualiser. |
| Build fails | wrong IDF version | Requires ESP-IDF v5.0+. |

## What's next (queued for IMU integration)

1. **Sensor fusion** — accelerometer + gyro on the same I²C bus. Gravity gives absolute pitch / roll; gyro integration plus accel-gravity correction tightens yaw, which is what unlocks a non-drifting 3D scan.
2. **Interpolated topographic surface** — bicubic interpolation across the 8×8 grid, rendered as a smooth 3D mesh with viridis colouring and contour lines every 100 mm.
3. **Proximity overlay** — highlight zones below a configurable threshold to flag obstacles in the helmet's line of sight.
4. **Helmet integration** — wider-angle ToF / ultrasonic for full spatial awareness.
