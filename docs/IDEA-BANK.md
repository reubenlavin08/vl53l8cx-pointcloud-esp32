# IDEA BANK — priority-ranked, expandable — rebuilt 2026-08-21

Every idea is a **collapsed dropdown** — click to expand for the what/why/
how. Ranked by priority (P0 → P3), best-first within each tier. Mark your
verdict on the title line: ✅ build / ❌ skip / 🕐 later. Effort: S <1
session · M 1–3 · L project. Sources live in `research-sources/`.

Legend: ✅ = you already ruled build · ⚖ = your call pending · 🕐 =
deferred with trigger · ❌ = ruled out (kept with reasons at the bottom).

## P0 — status (all resolved 2026-08-21)

> [!success]- ✅ IMU mount calibration — **DONE 2026-08-21**
> Voice-guided two-pose gravity calibration, verified all three axes,
> committed. Unlocks every IMU feature below (head-clearance, floor
> rejection, leveling accuracy, beacon tracking).

> [!note]- 🕐 VL53L8CX sunlight bench test [S] — deferred; trigger = before trusting any outdoor feature
> **What**: measure real max range indoors / shade / direct sun with a
> tape measure and cardboard target (15 min).
> **Why**: datasheet says range collapses 2.4 m (dark) → ~1 m at office
> brightness; sun is 10–20× brighter. Every outdoor warning distance
> (head-clearance 2 m, drop-off 2.5 m) assumes range we may not have.
> **Source**: [[platform-edge-safety-2026-08-20]], [[QA-2026-08-21]]

> [!note]- 🕐 CLOSEST vs STRONGEST target order A/B [S] — deferred; trigger = CV distances flapping
> **What**: firmware already runs CLOSEST. A/B = 20 s captures of a thin
> pole in front of a wall under each order; compare stability + pole
> visibility.
> **Why**: STRONGEST makes a 3 cm branch silently invisible (background
> wins); CLOSEST can flap on weak near returns. Multi-target mode can
> give BOTH: closest return for safety, strongest for stable CV ranges.

## P1 — highest impact per session (build next)

> [!note]- 1. ✅ Soundscape audio beacon — **BUILT, needs live camera test** [key `g`]
> **What**: lock a detected object; Soundscape's actual 4-region musical
> beacon (their MIT WAVs) leads you to it; arrival melody at 1 m.
> **Left to do**: first live test with camera + verify the lost-target
> IMU sign (marked in code — flip one sign if the beacon runs the wrong
> way when the object leaves frame).
> **Source**: [[soundscape-beacon-2026-08-20]], camera/beacon.py

> [!note]- 2. Head-clearance check in the GRAVITY frame [M] — your ✅ rule, done right
> **What**: warn when overhead clearance above the top ToF rays (in
> world coordinates, IMU-compensated) drops below your 10–15 cm margin.
> **Why gravity frame**: head pitch in normal walking is ±8° = ±140 mm
> at 2 m — more than the whole margin. Fixed "top row" is wrong at the
> definition level; prior art (Muñoz 2025) dodged this — it's our
> novelty claim. Alerts: first ≥2 m, hard 1.2 m.
> **Evidence**: 13% of blind people have head-level accidents monthly;
> cane AND dog users equally. ADA's 27–80 in band = "cane misses it,
> code says it shouldn't be there."
> **Source**: [[implementation-guide-2026-08-20]] §2

> [!note]- 3. Walkable-tunnel haptics [M] — .lumen's best mechanism, unclaimed
> **What**: a virtual corridor along your path; temple motors fire ONLY
> when you drift toward its walls. Silence when centered.
> **Why**: kills haptic fatigue vs continuous steering cues; described
> in .lumen's patent but NOT claimed — free to use. Fits our v11
> firmware directly.
> **Source**: [[patents-stripmine-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 4. GTFS-Realtime fusion [S-M] — cheapest huge win, nobody ships it
> **What**: TransLink's free live feed tells us which buses serve this
> stop and which is arriving NOW → open-set LED reading becomes picking
> between ~5 known strings (>99% practical accuracy).
> **Note**: with camera #2 ruled out, this powers stop-context +
> arrival announcements rather than long-range sign reading — still the
> backbone of any transit feature.
> **Source**: [[transit-gtfs-navilens-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 5. Glass detection: free experiment, then firmware signature [S → M]
> **What**: (a) free test at a glass door — CLOSEST order + 2
> targets/zone, see what the sensor reports; (b) then a TOPGN-style
> detector: flag zones with suspect status / multi-target / sigma
> spikes, require spatial coherence (glass = rectangular patch).
> **Why**: glass returns only ~4% of our light; a confidently-wrong
> range walks a user into a pane. OPEN RISK: unproven at 8×8 resolution
> — test early.
> **Source**: [[ultrasonic-mmwave-glass-2026-08-20]], [[implementation-guide-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 6. ✅ Signage / label OCR engine [M] — one engine, three features
> **What**: PARSeq text recognition (15 ms/crop) beside YOLO. Powers:
> label-reading-in-hand (your ✅), close signage à la Apple (your ✅),
> and **find-by-text** ("find Heinz" — your idea) at ~0.5–3 m.
> **Limit**: camera #2 ruled out ⇒ close range only (a 15 cm sign
> character is readable to ~3–5 m on the fisheye).
> **Source**: [[transit-headsign-ocr-2026-08-20]], [[QA-2026-08-20-part2]]

> [!note]- 7. Moving-vehicle interlock + blocked-path honesty [S]
> **What**: (a) never emit "step forward" unless ToF confirms zero
> closing velocity N frames — separate auditable module; (b) when fully
> blocked: stop and SAY so, never push through (Glide's behavior).
> **Why**: small code, disproportionate consequence; the one error
> class that ends trust permanently.
> **Source**: [[implementation-guide-2026-08-20]] §3b, [[glidance-deep-dive-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 8. Per-user ILD skull calibration [S] — now load-bearing
> **What**: 5-min lateralization sweep through the bone-conduction pair
> measuring YOUR skull's left-right crosstalk (varies ~40 dB between
> people); sets the pan exaggeration.
> **Why**: this is the scientifically correct "personalization" for BC
> — ear-photo HRTF personalization buys nothing (BC bypasses the ear).
> **Source**: [[bone-conduction-spatial-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 9. On-track reassurance ping + pulse-count haptic vocabulary [S]
> **What**: faint periodic pulse = "system alive, path clear" (silence
> never means dead battery); N pulses = semantic channel (2 = hazard
> ahead, 3 = turn coming); anti-lock-style burst texture = urgency.
> **Rule**: ≤2 motors simultaneously, prefer 1 — recognition falls
> 93% → 78% with 3-motor patterns (GuideTouch, n=22, p<1e-6).

## P2 — strong, after P1

> [!note]- 10. ✅ Queue detection + progress [M] — LineChaser pattern
> **What**: find the end of the line, "line moved, step forward," "you're
> next." Proven at CHI 2021 with exactly our sensors (camera + depth +
> person tracking).
> **Source**: [[QA-2026-08-20]], [[transit-bus-boarding-litreview-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 11. ✅ Empty-seat finding [M] — with the reframe decision open
> **What**: camera finds chairs, depth says which are empty, beacon
> guides. YOUR ✅.
> **The catch**: bags/coats on chairs are COCO's two worst detection
> classes — a false positive = sitting on someone's laptop. Research
> recommends the "describe the seating" variant (bearing + distance +
> honest confidence, you pick, beacon guides). Your call which version.
> **Source**: [[feasibility-pack-2026-08-20]] §4

> [!note]- 12. ✅ Crosswalk alignment [M-L] — BEV pipeline + Glide's spoken bookends
> **What**: bird's-eye rectify (IMU gravity) → stripe fit → geometric
> validators → LATCH heading at curb → closed-loop haptic correction
> across (veer is a random walk — open-loop pointing is useless past
> 4 m). "Approaching road" → you decide → "crossing complete."
> **The real project**: bearing precision (±3° needed); build the
> ground-truth rig first. Wet night = gyro-only fallback.
> **Never**: go/no-go calls. Alignment only.
> **Source**: [[implementation-guide-2026-08-20]] §4

> [!note]- 13. Terminal guidance to doors [L] — the U1 flagship
> **What**: detect door → ToF confirms real opening (depth behind) +
> range → beacon/haptics steer you to it. Door STATE from geometry
> (coplanar with wall = closed); hinge side from handle position; read
> the sign next to it (Apple's pattern).
> **Reality check**: unseen-environment door detectors are 13–48 mAP;
> our own capture loop (auto-label → correct → nightly fine-tune) is
> what makes it work: 15% local data took 20→76 mAP.
> **Source**: [[implementation-guide-2026-08-20]] §1

> [!note]- 14. Drop-off detection [M] — the one terrain carve-out
> **What**: down-ToF ground-plane-absent detection (stairs down, curbs,
> platform edges). Canes miss 1-in-5 to 1-in-3 drop-offs even with good
> technique.
> **Honest spec**: "extends cane drop-off coverage, degraded in full
> sun" (pending the sunlight test). False-positive discrimination
> (black mats, puddles) is the hard part, not detection.
> **Source**: [[feasibility-pack-2026-08-20]] §2, [[platform-edge-safety-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 15. Trajectory-prediction alerts [M] — biped's one good idea
> **What**: warn only on collision COURSE, not proximity — ByteTrack
> velocity + your own motion → per-object TTC; .lumen's 0.3 m
> predicted-trajectory gate as the threshold.
> **Source**: [[patents-stripmine-2026-08-20]], indoor-nav research

> [!note]- 16. Intervention logging → data flywheel [S-M] — Glidance's fleet learning at N=1
> **What**: 60 s ring buffer (video + ToF + IMU + what the system
> said); auto-save clips on: ToF/CV disagreement, user override,
> near-miss, low confidence, manual "flag that." Weekly: label failures
> → eval set first → retrain → replay old clips as regression tests.
> **Why**: every stumble becomes a training label; the telemetry schema
> is what turns one helmet into a fleet later.
> **Source**: [[glidance-deep-dive-2026-08-20]] (openpilot-verified pattern)

> [!note]- 17. Pose-aware floor rejection + speech gate on fast head turns [S each]
> **What**: (a) expected-floor-per-zone from live pitch replaces the
> crude row filter — kills look-down false alerts; (b) suppress routine
> speech while the head turns >~100°/s (sterile cockpit).
> **Unlocked by**: the IMU cal you just did.
> **Source**: [[imu-uses-2026-08-17]]

> [!note]- 18. Tap-to-query + auto-silence in vehicles [S each]
> **What**: the BNO085's on-chip tap detector = F9 without a keyboard
> (helmet shell is a good tap substrate); on-chip activity classifier
> silences callouts in cars/buses automatically.
> **Source**: [[imu-uses-2026-08-17]]

> [!note]- 19. Interrogation interface [M] — "tell me more"
> **What**: layered on-demand depth: F9/tap gives labels → repeat gives
> ranges → repeat gives details. The #1 requested interaction property
> in BLV studies. Around-Me variant: 4 quadrants, max ONE item each
> (Soundscape's pattern).
> **Source**: [[blv-daily-life-2026-08-18]], [[soundscape-beacon-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 20. Drop alarm [S] — helmet beeps when it falls off
> **What**: clip/tether or IMU-freefall trigger → helmet chirps so a
> blind owner can find it. A dropped helmet is invisible to its owner.
> **Source**: [[guidetouch-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 21. Distance low-pass + confidence dimming on audio [S each]
> **What**: muffled = far (blind users learn it instantly); dim the
> tick/beacon when sensor confidence drops — volume carries CONFIDENCE,
> never distance (bats actively remove the loudness cue).
> **Source**: [[hrtf-spatial-audio-2026-08-20]], [[biosonar-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 22. Steps instead of meters + clock-face option [S each]

## P3 — future / gated / on-trigger

> [!note]- 23. 🕐 Teach-and-repeat route retrace [L] — your ruling: interesting, not #1

> **Source**: [[patents-stripmine-2026-08-20]], GuideNav

> **Source**: [[feasibility-pack-2026-08-20]] §5

> [!note]- 25. Dropped-object mode, narrowed [M]
> **What**: head-aim floor search for phone/wallet/bottle-sized items
> ONLY (keys/coins are below the detection floor at 720p). Speech =

> **Source**: [[transit-assistance-synthesis-2026-08-20]]

> [!note]- 27. Platform-edge safety loop [M] — after the sunlight test
> **What**: independent ≤100 ms ToF loop; drop-off band signature +

## ❌ Rejected — with reasons (don't re-litigate without new evidence)

> [!failure]- Second boresighted narrow camera — YOUR ruling 2026-08-21
> Consequence accepted: no text at range (bus headsigns out), last-metre
> uses fisheye centre + ToF. The 4K SWAP (idea 48) remains available.

> [!failure]- Wired/DIY bone conduction install — YOUR ruling 2026-08-21
> Bluetooth BC accepted instead (speech + mono ticker + coarse beacon
> all tolerate BT latency). Wired AMCaoYiLi pair purchased $33.90 for
> September precision work; DIY transducer bonding dropped.

> [!failure]- Terrain narration — reopened by you, then closed by evidence
> ToF range collapses to ~1 m in sunlight = sees no farther than the
> cane sweeps; black ice is a material problem our sensor can't touch;
> hikers' revealed preference is poles/dog/buddy; IMU classification is
> reactive (feet do it free). Survivor: drop-off detection (idea 14) +
> the upward sensor as the real trail story.

> [!failure]- Currency detection — reopened by you, then closed by evidence
> Free apps (Cash Reader, Seeing AI) + 117k free BEP readers own it;
> CAD/EUR/GBP identifiable by touch; head camera makes framing WORSE
> than a phone. Demo-only at best.

> [!failure]- "Find me an empty seat" (naive auto-pick)
> Backpack/handbag are COCO's two worst classes; a false positive =
> public humiliation = abandonment. Reframed as idea 11.

> [!failure]- Open-space person-following
> Wrong identity ~20% of trajectory time (IDF1 75–80) on EASY
> benchmarks; from behind in coats ≈ coin flip; the elbow beats it
> walking; a UWB tag beats vision. Narrowed to idea 24.

> [!failure]- Go/no-go crossing calls
> The one error that kills; ACB/NFB positions agree. Alignment only.

> [!failure]- Faces/emotions/standalone pedestrian callouts
> Users explicitly reject person-callouts ("people move"); people stay
> as INPUTS to queue/follow/collision features. Face ID: see open
> questions.

> [!failure]- Full indoor SLAM / venue mapping
> GoodMaps' lane; needs infrastructure or beacons; our moat is
> perception, not mapping.

> [!failure]- PDR breadcrumb return-path
> 9 m error from one head turn — heads lead turns; killed by physics.
> (Teach-and-repeat, idea 23, is the viable cousin.)

> [!failure]- Continuous rich sonification (vOICe-style)
> 73 h training, zero adoption in 30 years.

> [!failure]- Loudness = distance
> Bats actively remove the cue; blind users are poor at absolute
> loudness. Volume = confidence only.

> [!failure]- Event cameras / cheap radar now / stochastic-resonance haptics
> Quote-only pricing + no pretrained detectors; zero azimuth + sees
> through walls; wrong physiological regime (our motors are
> supra-threshold).

> [!failure]- .lumen's continuous 100 Hz haptic "reins"
> Defensible alternative but conflicts with our silence-default
> evidence base; A/B someday, don't drift into it silently.
